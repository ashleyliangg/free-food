# FreeFood App
## Ashley Liang


## Overview
This website displays free food around campus. The finished project will be that students can input free food information through a form, and that information will be displayed on the main page for everyone to see. The website consists of a home page, which is the page with all the free food tiles; a food submission page, which is a page to submit free food information; and a form success page, which automatically navigates to when a user submits the form. The user can claim an item, which is decrement the number of serving available by one. The user can also report that there is none left by clicking the "none left" button. This project uses Firebase as its database.

## How to run this locally
`npm start`


### Credits
I want to credit Hermia for the initial design for the home page as well as Ben Levesque for a lot of the .css styling and initial homepage skeleton.

## My experience
I originally started this React App as a hackathon idea back in fall term that our group didn't complete. I was the only person with a bit of react experience, so I created the react app and helped others through the process of installing npm, etc. At the end of the hackathon, we ended up with a working card component and a homepage written in HTML and CSS with hard-coded cards.

I decided to build upon this project more this term; I wanted to create some sort of data structure holding the food data to create the cards so that it wasn't hard-coded in the HTML. I also wanted to develop a form that people could fill out to add to the free food data. 

I learned more about the Redux toolkit and Firebase through this project.
